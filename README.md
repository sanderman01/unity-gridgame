# unity-grids
A chunked grid system for use in the Unity3D game engine. This system intends to facilitate games containing grids with large numbers of tiles or blocks.

# Note. This is an experimental project!
This project is meant for quick and dirty designing/testing different approaches to this problem. At any time it may be messy and even basic functions may be broken. It may contain questionable design decisions. It is certainly nowhere near ready for anything resembling production use at this time.
