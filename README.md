# unity-gridgame
This project is an effort towards a 2D building game which aims to mix _Terraria_/_Starbound_ style procedurally generated and modifiable terrain grids with player-built structures and vehicles as in games like _Space Engineers_ or _Airships: Conquer the Skies_.

If feasible, I would like two include the following three domains into the game world:

* Land and air
* Underwater
* Space

This would allow the player to build cars, airships, submarines, space ships, or multipurpose vessels. All structures and vehicles created by the player will be irregular grids created out of 2D tiles/blocks.
